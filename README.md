# DailyPlanner
## Work Day Scheduler
[Daily planner](https://krcook1980.github.io/DailyPlanner/) for use to keep track of your work day. 
- The planner is broken down into 1 hour blocks for the work day.
- Past hours are grey, current hour is blue, and future hours are purple.
- Entering a task and pressing save will log that task in local storage so when you return, the task is still there.

## Construction Method
This site was made using JQuery, Moment.js, and Bootstrap. Utilized local storage in order to save tasks by specific hour. Used provided html and css file, however I altered the css styling to a more pleasing color palate for myself, as well as added a background image. Also created a new js file rather than coding inline with the html. 

- Page is responsive
- Symantec HTML used
- Used code validation services
- Commit to github as progress was completed
